## Description

The 'Top Bottom Indicator' is a custom indicator that calculates the top and bottom levels based on a moving average. It is designed to help traders identify potential entry points in the market. 

The indicator works by comparing the current price to a moving average. If the price is above the moving average, the indicator assigns a value of 100, indicating a potential top level.

The indicator is initialized with the following input parameters:
